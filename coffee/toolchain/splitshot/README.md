# Forked and built from `@hulu/splitshot`

This tool generates `.d.ts` files from `coffee` sources.  The `js` files
included here were generated via `npm run build` in the forked repo, and
then copied into here.  There are some minor changes to the original source
to support destructured `require`s, which we use heavily throughout our app.
